About Me
--------
I am a strategic technologist passionate about making impact where humans and cognitive technologies meet to improve health outcomes.

As an Entrepreneur...
---------------------
I am co-founder of ONTOADAPTIVE, LLC (OA) a Health Information Technology (HIT) consultancy in Chicago, IL.  
Currently, as a Director of Innovation, I advise a diverse range of clients ranging from medical associations, Digital Health
startups and HIT vendors.  

I have been part of two major U.S Healthcare informatics initiatives that have reach mainstream adoption.
One key informatics innovation known as the *cancer checklists* has reached above 25% adoption in the U.S. for pathologists.

Previous to my focus in U.S. Healthcare, I leveraged my experience working in large enterprise systems integration to lead 
product and development teams for startups using expert systems and knowledge representation as a core technology
platform differientiator.

As a Technology Leader...
-------------------------
I am active in Chicago entrepreneurship ecosystem.  Since 2014, I have advised a small portfolio of Chicago Digital Health startups and active
Healthcare track mentor for University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) for UIC Startup Challenge.  

In May 2017, I received the IL small business development center (SBDC) for OA's contributions in enhancing UIC's College of Business (COB) Capstone curriculum with experiential learning in Healthcare via customized
Digital Health bootcamp.

As a Practitioner...
--------------------
I am a hands on HIT architect fluent in latest HIT and informatics standards.  Additionally, I am proficient with state of the art methods such as
Human-centered design (HCD), Lean, and Agile.  From a technology perspective,  I have specialized in Cognitive Computing including breadth and depth in 
modern artificial intelligence (AI), knowledge representation, machine learning, deep learning, and cloud platforms.

Two cloud platforms I understand well are Microsoft and IBM Cognitive platforms including Microsoft Cognitive and IBM Watson services.  

As a Proactive Learner...
-------------------------
Ever since studying engineering at Purdue University for a BSIE and later a Human-computer interaction at DePaul University, I realized
my strengths in learning new perspective, methods and technologies.

As an early adopter of MOOCs, I have completed 20+ certifications to stay current and relevant.  However, I believe in a balanced approach to
higher education and maintain affiliations with academia in areas of decision science, human-computer interaction and computer science.
