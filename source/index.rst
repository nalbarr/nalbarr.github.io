About Me
--------
I am a strategic technologist passionate about making impact where humans and cognitive technologies meet to improve health outcomes.

As strategic technologist, my role is to learn domains fast and help teams learn along the way.  I spent a lot of time with stakeholders in the trenches aligning strategy with action.  This oscillates between problem and solution thinking which
requires wearing a variety of hats and lenses to perceive the world with.

As an Entrepreneur
------------------
I am co-founder of ONTOADAPTIVE, LLC (OA), a Health Information Technology (HIT) consultancy in Chicago, IL.  
As a Director of Innovation, I advise and consult for a range of clients ranging from medical associations, Digital Health
startups and HIT vendors.  

I have been part of two major U.S Healthcare informatics initiatives that have reached mainstream adoption.
One key informatics innovation known as the *cancer checklists* has reached above 25% adoption in the U.S. for pathologists.
Another is an evidence-based cancer staging application programming interface (API) and launched recently as national standard
for cancer reporting.

Previous to my focus in U.S. Healthcare, I was an product architect with a large systems integrator learning core fundamentals
to product delivery and systems engineering across complex domains.  Later, I gained confidence to take more risk within startups and
further specialized in product innovation using cross disciplinary approaches including: human-computer interaction (HCI), expert systems
production rules, and knowledge representation.

As a Technology Leader
----------------------
I am :ref:`active<leadership>` in Chicago entrepreneurship ecosystem.  Since 2014, I have been a Healthcare track mentor for University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) 
for UIC Startup Challenge and continue to advise selected Chicago Digital Health startups.

In May 2017, I received an Enterpreneurship Award from the IL Small Business Development Center (SBDC) for my contributions to UIC's College of Business (COB) 
programs by enhancing Capstone course curriculum with *Digital Health Bootcamp* content and resulting in successful team competitions.

Additionally since 2015, I am a member of Loyola University Chicago Computer Science Program Advisory Committee (CSPAC) where we focus on aligning
graduate programs with real world industry perspectives.

As a Practitioner
-----------------
I am a hands on architect fluent in latest HIT and informatics standards.  Additionally, I am proficient with state of the art methods such as
Human-centered design (HCD), Lean, and Agile.  From a technology perspective,  I am further :ref:`specialized<skills>` in Cognitive Computing including breadth and depth in 
modern artificial intelligence (AI), knowledge representation, machine learning, deep learning, and cloud platforms.

I understand Microsoft and IBM Cognitive platforms well including Microsoft Cortana and IBM Watson variants.  I am a full stack architect with a polyglot
perspective and fluent in both JVM and .NET ecosystems.

Although I am not a full time researcher, I colloborate with researchers and am :ref:`published<publications>` in Health Informatics.

As an Continual Learner
-----------------------
I started wth natural systems thinking foundation with a bachelors of science in Industrial and Systems Engineering (BSIE) from Purdue University.  After years of industry experience,
I went back to complement systems thinking with new design thinking perspectives and completed a masters of science (MHCI) in Human-Computer interaction at DePaul University.  Under faculty
direction, I spent my last year specializing in domain specific UIs and task based interfaces.

As an early adopter of MOOCs, I have completed 20+ :ref:`certifications<certifications>` to stay current and relevant within Healthcare and Digital Health.  

I believe in a balanced approach to education balancing higher education and experiential learning with MOOCs and maintain affiliations with academia in areas of Health Informatics, Decision Science, Human-computer Interaction and Computer Science.
This includes Duke University, UIC, DePaul University and Loyola University Chicago.

What I've Learned and Still Learning
------------------------------------
You can learn more about someone by what they seek, learn and apply.  Here is a curated list of :ref:`resources<resources>` that are my favorites and I share with peers
and mentees.  Also, here are some :ref:`projects<projects>` that highlight past performance and current curiousities.
