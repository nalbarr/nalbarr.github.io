<h2>About Me<a class="headerlink" href="#about-me" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>I am a strategic technologist passionate about making impact where humans and cognitive technologies meet to improve health outcomes.</p>
<p>As strategic technologist, my role is to learn domains fast and help teams learn along the way.  I spent a lot of time with stakeholders in the trenches aligning strategy with action.  This oscillates between problem and solution thinking which
requires wearing a variety of hats and lenses to perceive the world with.</p>

<div class="section" id="as-an-entrepreneur">
<h2>As an Entrepreneur<a class="headerlink" href="#as-an-entrepreneur" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>I am co-founder of ONTOADAPTIVE, LLC (OA), a Health Information Technology (HIT) consultancy in Chicago, IL.
As a Director of Innovation, I advise and consult for a range of clients ranging from medical associations, Digital Health
startups and HIT vendors.</p>
<p>I have been part of two major U.S Healthcare informatics initiatives that have reached mainstream adoption.
One key informatics innovation known as the <em>cancer checklists</em> has reached above 25% adoption in the U.S. for pathologists.
Another is an evidence-based cancer staging application programming interface (API) and launched recently as national standard
for cancer reporting.</p>
<p>Previous to my focus in U.S. Healthcare, I was an product architect with a large systems integrator learning core fundamentals
to product delivery and systems engineering across complex domains.  Later, I gained confidence to take more risk within startups and
further specialized in product innovation using cross disciplinary approaches including: human-computer interaction (HCI), expert systems
production rules, and knowledge representation.</p>

<h2>As a Technology Leader<a class="headerlink" href="#as-a-technology-leader" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>I am <a class="reference internal" href="leadership.html#leadership"><span class="std std-ref">active</span></a> in Chicago entrepreneurship ecosystem.  Since 2014, I have been a Healthcare track mentor for University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC)
for UIC Startup Challenge and continue to advise selected Chicago Digital Health startups.</p>
<p>In May 2017, I received an Enterpreneurship Award from the IL Small Business Development Center (SBDC) for my contributions to UIC’s College of Business (COB)
programs by enhancing Capstone course curriculum with <em>Digital Health Bootcamp</em> content and resulting in successful team competitions.</p>
<p>Additionally since 2015, I am a member of Loyola University Chicago Computer Science Program Advisory Committee (CSPAC) where we focus on aligning
graduate programs with real world industry perspectives.</p>

<div class="section" id="as-a-practitioner">
<h2>As a Practitioner<a class="headerlink" href="#as-a-practitioner" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>I am a hands on architect fluent in latest HIT and informatics standards.  Additionally, I am proficient with state of the art methods such as
Human-centered design (HCD), Lean, and Agile.  From a technology perspective,  I am further <a class="reference internal" href="skills.html#skills"><span class="std std-ref">specialized</span></a> in Cognitive Computing including breadth and depth in
modern artificial intelligence (AI), knowledge representation, machine learning, deep learning, and cloud platforms.</p>
<p>I understand Microsoft and IBM Cognitive platforms well including Microsoft Cortana and IBM Watson variants.  I am a full stack architect with a polyglot
perspective and fluent in both JVM and .NET ecosystems.</p>
<p>Although I am not a full time researcher, I colloborate with researchers and am <a class="reference internal" href="publications.html#publications"><span class="std std-ref">published</span></a> in Health Informatics.</p>

<div class="section" id="as-an-continual-learner">
<h2>As an Continual Learner<a class="headerlink" href="#as-an-continual-learner" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>I started wth natural systems thinking foundation with a bachelors of science in Industrial and Systems Engineering (BSIE) from Purdue University.  After years of industry experience,
I went back to complement systems thinking with new design thinking perspectives and completed a masters of science (MHCI) in Human-Computer interaction at DePaul University.  Under faculty
direction, I spent my last year specializing in domain specific UIs and task based interfaces.</p>
<p>As an early adopter of MOOCs, I have completed 20+ <a class="reference internal" href="certifications.html#certifications"><span class="std std-ref">certifications</span></a> to stay current and relevant within Healthcare and Digital Health.</p>
<p>I believe in a balanced approach to education balancing higher education and experiential learning with MOOCs and maintain affiliations with academia in areas of Health Informatics, Decision Science, Human-computer Interaction and Computer Science.
This includes Duke University, UIC, DePaul University and Loyola University Chicago.</p>
